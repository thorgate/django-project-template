## Usage

To use this template, first ensure that you have
[Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme.html) available. 
If not, you can install it from pip: `pip install cookiecutter`.

Then just execute:
    
    cookiecutter dir/to/django-project-template/

It will ask you a few questions, e.g. project's name.

After generation completes, search for any TODOs in the code and make appropriate changes where needed.

See README.md in the generated project for instructions on how to set up your development environment.


## Project types

This template supports two slightly different project types. You'll need to choose one at the project generation time:

- _Standard_ - Django project with some JavaScript/React augmentations. Uses Django's routing, views and templates to 
  render the HTML pages. JavaScript and React components can then be added to make parts of those pages dynamic.
- _SPA_ (single-page application) - Django is used only to provide API. The frontend is a separate single-page
  application written in React. All routing and rendering logic is in JavaScript. Note that this is based on an older
  React version ATM.
