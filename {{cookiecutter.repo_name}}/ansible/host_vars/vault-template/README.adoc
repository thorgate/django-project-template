= Ansible vault template

From the DPT the test server should be generated already, the template should be already filled out with values for
production. But

== Adding new deployment

* Copy to `vault-template` and rename it to deployment server hostname
* Fill in all the TODOs that are needed:
** `django_site_host`
*** Must be valid FQDN
** `node_site_host`
*** Must be valid FQDN
*** fill in if present
*** prepend extra path to `django_site_host` as cannot be hosted on the same domain
** `letsencrypt_reminder_email` - Email where certificate expire emails will be sent by Lets Encrypt
* Add to `ansible/inventory` to correct deployment environment section
